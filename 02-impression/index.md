## My best portfolio pieces

![Screenshot from title slide of presentation.](img/00-title.jpg)

My name is Diana. I went to the high school of building construction and then got a requalification course in graphic design programs. Soon after I had a job in the DTP department in the graphic studio, where I worked for one year. There I found my love for graphic design and illustrations and decided to go to university.

### Notes

Numbered comments correspond to slide order.

1. Shoptet

When I think about my best portfolio pieces my mind goes immediately to my freelance work for Shoptet. Shoptet is the biggest E-commerce platform in the Czech Republic with over 28 000 e-shops running on their servers and a 21 billion dollars annual turnover. You might be asking…

2. What?

… Why on earth did they hire me? Well, let me tell you a story about how I have got to do my 3 favorite portfolio pieces. It all started in summer 2019 right before I started as a freshman in this very school.

3. Summer 2019

I had a lot of time on my hands and not much to do so I was trying my luck on the topdesigner.cz website.

4. Topdesigner

Topdesigner is a site with open tenders where anyone can join in with their design proposal. And it was here where I found a Shoptet tender for office murals with their mascot Shoptetrix. After a week of working I send in my proposals.

5. Proposal

Which you can see here.

6. Mural

After another week I have got a call from the CEO telling me that I won the competition and asking for another 6 murals.

7. CEO

After I infiltrated Shoptet offices with my illustrations it was very hard for the CEO to stop thinking about me. So short time after he asked me to create a series of web illustrations and uplift of Shoptet's main page.

8. Web illustrations

I have got a list of 14 main services that Shoptet offers to their users and created an illustration for each. 

9. Main page

I used those illustrations in the main page uplift. After few smaller jobs on different subpages I have got my third best portfolio piece job.

10. Shoptet premium

The landing page design for Shoptet's new platform called Shoptet premium which launched this year.

11. Illustrations

And a mini-series of illustrations for Shoptet premium related presentations to clients.
