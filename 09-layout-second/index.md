## Abstract

This paper is focused on creating a unified visual identity for the book series Ještědské romány and connecting it with a suitable marketing solution. The resulting concept should help reintroduce the Czech writer from the May School group and one of the first Czech feminists Karolina Světlá to the people of age 18-40yo (and at the same time support the sale of the books). The theoretical part deals with the writer's life, work and merits in the field of feminism. It examines the development of the book Vesnický román (the first book in the Ještědské romány series) in detail and looks at Karolina Světlá's inheritance in the Podještědské Museum. It introduces the issues of book production and contains a quick insight into the book market. The graphic solution in the practical part connects the old elements with the new ones so that the books remain true to their content, but at the same time address the target group.
