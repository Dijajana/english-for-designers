## About

I am Diana, illustrator, graphic designer and mediocre ukulele player based in Kutná Hora. With my front-end developer husband and our 9 months old son we live in the beautiful historical city of Kutná Hora right next to a river and a deciduous forest. There I am working on illustrations, and web and print designs.
