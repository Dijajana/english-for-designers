I am an illustrator, graphic designer, and mediocre ukulele player based in Kutná Hora. With my front-end developer husband and our 1 year old son, we live in the beautiful historical city of Kutná Hora right next to a river and a deciduous forest. Here I am working on illustrations, and web and print designs.
