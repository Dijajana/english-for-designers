# Finding your life career path as a teeanager
and what if you fail.

by Diana Štěpničková


I was fourteen when my career path began. I had to pick a high school which would set me on the right path to getting my dream job. Dream jobs however werent on my mind. Freed from the kids elementary school all I wanted was to meet new people and socialize. My career will be handled when I get there. So it happened that the "There will always be constructions in the future" argument was enough for me to join construction high school. I was also going to be one of the only two girls in the classroom, so I had that "changing stereotypes" and "fighting the patriarchy" spirit going for me. 

Soon I found out that all the other guys and the girl have construction experience or interests hence why they joined the school. I myself was wondering why the ceiling is hanging in there and not falling down. That was unfortunately the only thing that interested me about houses and after I found that one out there was no interest left. We got a teacher who would read building construction repair methods to us for hours and another one who was vivid when we didn't understand her constructive geometry lecture. Then we had a teacher who would simply tell us to make a house project and left to work on his own projects. The only class I felt like I belong to was our technical writing atelier. Here we could actually draw. Not our own pictures, but we were redrawing designs of famous architects and even learnign some caligraphy. I was about to make some serious money for doing homeworks for my classmates but our teacher noticed right away and said that three best works are done by the same hand. The years went past and then we were graduating. All my teachers knew by then, that I don't belong in the field. My house project was a disaster and they let me pass with the lowest passible grade. I also had to promise the board that I will not pursue a carrer in construction or try to get any higher education in the field.

It was college time. With the construction career out of the way I had to find another path. Fresh start. I could almost see the happy ending here. But this time I had an IT industry in mind. Just like construction - industry with future and not a lot of women in it. So I moved to Jihlava to study applied informatics and repeated the exactly same mistake again. This time I realized much sooner. I couldn't even go through the first week. Not only I was the only girl this time, but most of the other guys already studied the applied informatics in high school for 4 years. All the teachers were building right on that. They needed me to understand the processor unit in the first class but all I could give them was the roof truss composition breakdown. So I left and gave up on school. After my history with the education system my parents didn't have much hope for me being able to finish collage so they didn't presure me to study further. 

I was free to be a grownup. I also failed terribly in chosign the career path for myself. And I still didnt care. I wanted to see the world. With my future husband we traveled and worked as seasonal workers around Europe and in New Zealand. We ended up on a small Portuguese goat farm for few months runned by single man in his forties - Dave, who offered us food and shelter in exchange for our work. After the first month I got really good in shepherding the goats and learned how to stand my ground with the male goat. Instead of leting them out in to the coop I could take them for a hike out to the mountains where there was tons of food. There was also a lot of fun for me due to the "scared woman" scream the goats are making when they don't see the herd. For lunch we would eat fresch sardines and share stories with Dave and in the afternoon we would ride the single bike with my husband down the mountain to the nearest beach. It was heaven and it was there when I realized that I don't want to spend my life in the office. The farm wasnt how Dave made his living. For him to be able to live in the mountains he had to work as a freelance developer. And finally at this moment while handing a fresh bamboo to a goat I made my first actuall career decision. Whatever I do it has to be freelance. With my husband slowly becoming a developer himself I soon heard about graphic designers.
