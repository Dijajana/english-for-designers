# The moment I realized that I want to be a graphic designer 
by Diana Štěpničková

I tried to design. After learing how to awkvardly operate an illustrator I tried to design my very own business card. And at last! A craft that I can hone. "Diana Štěpničková" I'm writing down in illustrator next to my very first vector illustration that I'm overly proud of. After admiring the ilustration some more I'm adding a smaller "Graphic designer" under the name. Imagining - not a career with rutine tasks repeating in tiring circle. But a skill to nurture and wield throughout my life. No other path ever called me so strongly. I clicked with design like Romeo did with Juliet. Every minute spend on design is a minute well spend thanks to the promise I didn't even realized I'm making to myself. I will become a great designer. No matter how long it will take. None can stop me.

That was the moment I realized that I want to be a graphic designer. But one does not simply become a designer. At first I thought I had it all figured out. It is a matter of taste. I can spot a beautifull design so I must be able to created as well. But when I tried to design a random project, the results were catastrophic. More I learned about design the more lost I felt. After series of jobs for busines owners that didn't want to spend their budget on actual designers and a one year of busy work in a local graphic studio I still wasn't a proper designer. Let alone a great one. 
Why don't I ever work on projects like I see on dribbble. Those brands and designs that just feel right. Looking like there couldn't possibly be a better way to design them. Everything fitting together in a perfect visual orchestra. I needed to get on board. I needed to learn from actual designers. Have them show me their ways. Learn all their secrets. So I gathered my best pieces and applied to design school. 

In college it was made clear to me that my goal isn't to create beautiful design at all. The visual side of design is only manifestation of a deeper meanigful message that stands behind it. Pretty image is rendered useles unless it caries a meaning. That shook my determination. Not only I need to learn how to create stunning work. I need to find some deeper meaning as well. Every single time. But what seemed to be such a bother at the begining become a key to desiging later. This was why my desings doesn't work. They don't make any sense.
