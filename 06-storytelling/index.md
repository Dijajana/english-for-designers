# The moment I realized that I want to be a graphic designer 
by Diana Štěpničková



I tried to design. At last! A craft that I can hone. A skill to nurture and wield throughout my life. No other craft called me so strongly. I clicked with design like Romeo did with Juliet. Every minute spend on design is worth it now thanks to the promise I didn't even realized I made to myself. I will become a great designer. No matter how long it will take. None can stop me.
That was the moment I realized that I want to be a graphic designer. But one does not simply become a graphic designer. After series of jobs for busines owners that didn't want to spend their budget on actual designers and a one year of busy work in a local graphic studio I still wasn't a proper one. Let alone a great one.
