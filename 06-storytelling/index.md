As a child I was never guided towards a creative career and from my point of view - my career was something in a far away future, that will be handled when I get there. So it happened that the "There will always be constructions in the future" argument was enough for me to join construction high school. I was also going to be one of the only two girls in the classroom, so I had that "changing stereotypes" and "fighting the patriarchy" spirit going for me. I loved the idea that I'm going to do something unexpected for a girl. So even when I found out that all the other guys and the girl (daughter of a construction firm owner) have construction experience hence why they joined the school, while I didn't even understand why the ceiling is hanging in there and not falling down, I pulled through. I didn't care how many extra hours I need to learn constructive geometry and building construction repairs. I will not be blamed for "half the girls" failing construction schools. The only class I felt like I belong in was our technical writing atelier. Here we could actually DRAW. Of course we couldn't draw our own pictures, but we were technically redrawing designs of famous architects and even learnign some caligraphy. I was about to make some serious money on doing And than we were graduating. All my teachers new by then, that I don't belong in the field. My house project was a disaster and they let me pass with the lowest passible grade at my graduation. I also had to promise the board that I will not pursue a carrer in construction or try to get any higher education in the field.
It was college time. With the construction career out of the way I had to find another path. Fresh start. I could almost see the happy ending here.. but this time I had an IT industry in mind. Just like construction - industry with future and not a lot of women in it. So I moved to Jihlava to study applied informatics and repeated the exactly same mistake again. This time I realized much sooner because it was much worse. I couldn't even go through the first week. I was the only girl and most of the other guys already studied the applied informatics in high school for 4 years. All the teachers were building right on that. They needed me to understand the processor unit in the first class but all I could give them was the roof truss composition breakdown. So I left and gave up on school. After my history with the education system my parents didn't have much hope for me being able to finish collage so they didn't presure me to study further. I was free to be a grownup.
