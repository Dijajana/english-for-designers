# Voice & Tone

In my texts for this class I tried to not sound too serious, but still convey the story fittingly. If it was getting too serious I usually added a joke here and there to keep the reader interested. 

## Voice

I used to have a very quiet voice when I was in my teenage years so it was hard for people around me to hear what I was saying. So the first thing I'm concentrating on when talking is saying things loud and clear. I try to be honest and open about everything because it makes it easier for people to relate to me. I'm however still very nervous when presenting so sometimes I can sound disconnected or uninterested.

## Tone

I have many tones to my voice. With my closest friends, I have basically no boundaries. I love to be completely honest, oversharing, and cheeky. With a client, I try to sound more professional and I'm not so fast to tell them about all the things that almost when horribly with their project but turn out fine at the end. But I still like to maintain a certain level of openness. I'm not afraid to share my doubts or ask ten times if I don't understand something. 
Above that, I feel like I have a tone for every single person that I interact with. When I'm talking to someone I found myself subconsciously "vibing" with them to match their tone and mood so we can connect better.

## Style

When I have the story ready, I review the individual chapters. I work on the overall structure making sure it is clear and understandable.
I always try to have one main heading and a few meaningful subheadings so the reader can orient herself in the text without reading it.
