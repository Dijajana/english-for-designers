## My Story

![Alt text description.](img/profilovka.png)
It would be easy to say that I always dreamed about being an illustrator since I was little, while scribbeling drawings all over my school notes. But I didn't.
I found my love for illustrations when I was about 23. I was attending a graphic design course as a part of the EU youth support program which got me a job in a DTP department of the graphic studio. Since then I knew there is nothing else I want to do than graphic design and illustrations.

With my front-end developer husband and our 9 months old son we live in the beautiful historical city of Kutná Hora right next to a river and a deciduous forest. At this moment it is my third year studying graphic design program in the college of creative communication. I have working experience in illustration, web design, print design and visual identity.
