## My Story

With my front-end developer husband and our 9 months old son we live in the beautiful historical city of Kutná Hora right next to a river and a deciduous forest. At this moment it is my third year studying graphic design program in the college of creative communication. I have working experience in illustration, web design, print design and visual identity.

It would be easy to say that I always dreamed about being an illustrator since I was little, while scribbeling drawings all over my school notes. But I didn't.
I found my love for illustrations considerably later. I was attending a graphic design course as a part of the EU youth support program and it got me a job in a DTP (desktop publishing) department of the graphic studio. Since then I knew there is nothing else I want to do for living than graphic design and illustrations.
