## Shoptet's "What we do" page

Being an e-commerce platform Shoptet's bussines is based on the internet. More specificaly on their page shoptet.cz. It is the face that their showing the world and therefore one of the most important parts of their bussines. Shopted aimed to make the main page and first subpage "What we do" more visualy atractive for users. That's why they asked me to create a color scheme and illustrations.  

There are 14 main services that shopted offers. I got a list of all of them with a short description. Then I needed to come up with a concept for each illustration that would fit the category and its description the best.
